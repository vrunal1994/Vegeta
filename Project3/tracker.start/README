I got the idea for the game from the lego keychain I had.

Details:
Two multiframe sprites ie. The Batman are the joker traverse arond the edges of the viewport and then change direction. Similarly a single sprite of batman logo traverses the width of the viewport, reading from game.xml.

The projects does parallax scrolling with three images. 1. Building Background 2. Clouds 3. Batsign.
The buildings move the fastest with factor of 1, followed by Clouds and then the Bat sign.
