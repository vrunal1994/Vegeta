Project description: Charlizard vs Vegeta

Game theme:Vegeta needs to collect dragon balls and Charlizard has to prevent Vegeta from doing so.
 Vegeta has plasma throwing powers and Charlizard is capable to throw fireballs in projectile motion.
 Dragon balls would be dropped from the sky using Painter's algorithm.

Game Mechanics: 
    Collisions: Charlizard <--> Vegeta (Fireball and Plasma shootings)
                Vegeta <--> Dragon Balls (Collection of balls)

    Explosions: if health of Vegeta reduces by collisions to fireballs of Charlizard, 
                 Vegeta may die. Similary for Charlizard.
