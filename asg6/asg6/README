Project description: Charizard vs Vegeta
Project Parnter: Vrunal Mhatre
Contribution: Worked on Charizard Collision, Explosion, Bullets and Object pooling for bullets. 
Game theme:Vegeta needs to collect dragon balls and Charizard has to prevent Vegeta from doing so.
 Vegeta has plasma throwing powers and Charizard is capable to throw fireballs in projectile motion.
 Dragon balls would be dropped from the sky using Painter's algorithm.

Objective:
	Object Pooling: To ensure bullets are reused using freeList and bulletList
    Bullets: Press button 'E' to shoot Plasma from Vegeta.
             Press button 'Right_Ctrl' to shoot Fireball from Charlizard.
	Explosions: Collision with Fireball emitted from Charlizard explodes Vegeta.
    Collisions: Charizard <--> Vegeta (Fireball and Plasma shootings)		        
    Reset:  Use Button 'R' to Reset the game
	
Game Mechanics for future projects:
